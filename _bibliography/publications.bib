  abstract = {We develop here a spatially resolved, three-dimensional continuum model coupling cluster dynamics (SR-CD) and crystal plasticity to investigate irradiation growth in zirconium. The model uses scale separation to divide the population of the irradiation cluster into mobile and immobile families. Small interstitial and vacancy clusters are modeled using anisotropic reaction–diffusion equations. Among the immobile clusters, an atomistically-informed vacancy cluster to vacancy loop transition is taken into account. The coupling between the evolution equation of CD and the plastic deformation of the material is two-fold, with stress-informed bias factors and local inelastic strains computed from the evolution of the evolving cluster population. The numerical implementation of the model utilizes the finite element method to analyze both single-crystal and polycrystalline samples. The growth strains that are computed align well with the experimental data provided by Carpenter for single-crystal Zr. Furthermore, the transformation of a vacancy cluster into a complete vacancy loop, occurring at a size of 14 nm, is in agreement with experimental observations and atomistic simulations. The density, size, and growth rate of the dislocation loops, denoted as 〈c〉 and 〈a〉, also exhibit good agreement with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis of irradiated Zr and its alloys. Our findings demonstrate that there is a spatial correlation between the growth of these dislocation loops and growth strains, significantly influenced by the crystal size. To explain the expansion of the 〈a〉 axis and the contraction of the 〈c〉 axis in irradiated Zr, it is necessary to consider the diffusion anisotropy difference (DAD) of mobile interstitial species. We show that the PWR Kearns parameters, specifically fr = 0.63, ft = 0.32, fa = 0.05, confer enhanced irradiation resistance to Zr along the principal directions when compared to single crystals. Additionally, reducing the grain size to nanograins further enhances the resistance to irradiation-induced growth, particularly along the direction with the highest volume fraction of basal poles [0001].}

title = {Mg and native defects in cubic silicon carbide from first principles},
journal = {Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics},
abstract = {The diffusion of Mg defects in 3C-SiC is studied using the density functional theory. Mg has the highest burn-in rate as a transmutant in 3C-SiC when it is placed in high-energy neutron irradiation environment of a fusion reactor. The presence and evolution of transmutant defects impact thermal and mechanical properties of this important structural material. This study is focused on understanding the structure, stability, and evolution of Mg defects and the interaction of Mg with native defects in 3C-SiC. Our calculations of diffusion coefficients for different Mg defects suggest that Mg is likely to diffuse faster in pristine 3C-SiC than in the damaged one, in agreement with earlier experimental observations.}

  abstract = {The zinc-blende polytype of silicon carbide, known as 3C-SiC, is a promising ceramic material in high-temperature energy applications. However, the reported data on its mechanical and electronic properties, especially at elevated temperatures, are either lacking or scarce, with sizeable uncertainty. In this study, we present a comprehensive study on the temperature-dependent mechanical and electronic properties of 3C-SiC. First-principles calculations are combined with the quasi-harmonic approximation to investigate lattice properties at elevated temperature. We find that phonons dominate the temperature-dependent behavior. As temperature increases, all elastic constants exhibit a softening trend, and 3C-SiC becomes more elastically anisotropic. Our calculated degree of softening of elasticity is weaker than the values reported by previous studies. Moreover, the effects of thermal expansion and electron–phonon coupling on the electron band energy at elevated temperatures are investigated. The electron–phonon coupling dominates the temperature dependence of the band gap, where 3C-SiC maintains its wide gap at high temperature.},
