    We know by inspection that the content of the reference variable includes
    an enclosing HTML <span></span> tag.  Since the DOI or URL is at the end
    of the reference, it will butt up against the span and we need to take
    account of that in the regex.  This way is a bit kludgey, in that it
    *requires* the url to be terminated by the span tag.  Room for improvement.

{{ reference | regex_replace: '(https?:\/\/\S+)(\<\/span\>)', '<a href="\1">\1</a>\2' }}

    These are internal links, generated by jekyll-scholar.
    They don't appear in the CSL rendered citation, so we
    need to add them.

{% if links.pdf %}
<a href="{{ links.pdf }}">{{ links.pdf | absolute_url }}</a>

    Display the abstract and bibtext entry using the HTML
    "accordian" tag, so that the details are available, but
    by default, they don't clutter the page.
{% endcomment %}

{% if entry.abstract %}
<details><summary>Abstract</summary><p>{{ entry.abstract }}</p></details>
{% endif %}

{% if entry.bibtex %}
<details><summary>BibTeX</summary><pre>{{ entry.bibtex }}</pre></details>
