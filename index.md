## Project Summary

![Representative first wall/blanket design](/assets/images/first-wall-mesg-150.png){: .align-right}

The objective of this project is to develop an integrated computational model linking the materials physics scale with the component-level scale to simulate the thermomechanical response of the full first wall/blanket structures during fusion reactor operation.  Phenomena of interest at the three modeling scales include:



1. Fundamental properties ("Level 1")
    1. Transmutant inventory changes
    2. Dose- and material chemistry-dependent PKA energy distributions
    3. Displacement cascades in isotopically-changing environments
    4. Chemical environment-dependent defect structures
    5. Irradiation defect distributions
    6. Tritium transport/trapping in chemically evolving environments
2. Microstructural evolution ("Level 2")
    1. Irradiation hardening, creep, and swelling
    2. Grain growth/recrystallization
    3. Tritium permeation and retention
3. Component evaluation ("Level 3")
    1. Integrated thermomechanical evolution of selected design(s)
    2. Design findings/recommendations

We will also carry out assessments of the uncertainties associated with various phenomena to inform the integrated models.

## Publications and Presentations

*We're just getting started.  We'll add papers and publications once we start producing them.*

But if you're looking for more information about our plans, here is a [public version of our original proposal](/assets/documents/proposal-public.pdf).  Note that this version does *not* include scope changes in response to budget changes at award time.
